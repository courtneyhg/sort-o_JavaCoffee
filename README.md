### Bubble Sort
  * Best Case: The numbers are from least to greatest (already sorted) or the numbers are all the same.
  * Worst Case: The numbers are from greatest to least.

When the size of the arrays are the same, it takes the same number of passes to
sort it. However, we looked at how many times numbers were swapped. In our best
cases, it took 0 swaps and 6 passes. Meanwhile, in our worst case, it took 15 swaps
and 6 passes.

### Selection Sort
  * No best or worst case

The passes and swaps always remain the same no matter how the arrays are ordered.

### Insertion Sort
  * Best Case: The numbers are from least to greatest (already sorted) or the numbers are all the same.
  * Worst Case: The numbers are from greatest to least.

When the size of the arrays are the same, it takes the same number of passes to
sort it. However, we looked at how many times numbers were swapped. In our best
cases, it took 0 swaps and 5 passes. Meanwhile, in our worst case, it took 15 swaps
and 5 passes.
